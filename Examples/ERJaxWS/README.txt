and how to register this with your WOApplication

these using wsimport from Java 6.

  - provide a WebService implementing a generated interface
    based on a given WSDL, all generated stuff is in a jar file
    and had been created using

  - provide and use a stateful WebService

  - use WebFaults, generated by throwing Exceptions
